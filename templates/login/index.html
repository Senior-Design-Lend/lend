  <h3>Lend is a service that allows users to lend out and borrow items from other users. There are many times when a person wants to use some items,
  but they don't want to fully purchase it. They'll only need it once and then never again. Or maybe someone forgot something at home and needs
  it for that day. Why buy a new item completely when someone can lend it out to you instead?</h3>
